## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- Add friends to the friends list without mutating the original array
- get a random id with crypto.randomUUID() method
- conditionally render the addFriend Form

### Built with

- CSS custom properties
- JavaScript
- React
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid

### What I learned

1. learned to create a static project first before adding state for dynamic rendering
2. how to split a function into its own component using refactor option
3. custom components are a blank slate and properties like onClick that come prepackaged need to be sent in as properties
4. using spread operator instead of mutating original array
5. direct state toggle vs functional update. Functional update is better when new state is derived from old state
6. making a form, updating state, binding inputs to state variables, using a guard clause for falsy input values

### Continued development

I want to continue to grow my knowledge of React and its many capabilities.
